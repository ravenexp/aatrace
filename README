aatrace - Yet another ASCII-art generator

1. Building

$ make

while (!works)
      tweak(Makefile);

2. Usage

Generate differentiated image:

$ ./testdiff input.pgm output.pgm

Generate ASCII text file and the rendered text image:

$ ./testconv input.pgm diffoutput.pgm font/font8x16.pgm output.txt output.pgm

^^
All arguments are required.
diffoutput.pgm is an intermediate bitmap output identical to
the one generated by testdiff.

font8x16.pgm is the VGA terminal font image supplied as a sample.
The font bitmap characters are stacked vertically starting from
the whitespace character (ASCII 0x20).

All image files are in the Portable GrayMap (PGM) format.
ImageMagick or netpbm may be used to generate compatible input(s) and
convert output(s) into something more usable.

3. Tweaking

Tweaking definitions in aatrace.h:

Changing AATRACE_DIFF_SCALE (gradient map scaling)
roughly adjust ASCII "brightness".
Changing aatrace_diff (differentiation kernel size)
adjust detail/noise sensitivity.
Check generated diffoutput.pgm to see the effect of the adjustments.
