aatrace - Yet another ASCII-art generator

1. Building

$ make

while (!works)
      tweak(Makefile);

2. Usage

Using convenience wrapper script:

$ ./aaconvert.sh [-l <scale>] [-d <kernel>] [-m <id>] [-s <id>] [-c <1/0>] [-W <sad>.<asd>] image.pgm

Generates image.diff.pgm, image.ascii.txt and image.ascii.pgm files
in the current directory.
image.diff.pgm is an intermediate differentiated image output,
image.ascii.txt is the text output and image.ascii.pgm is the image output.

When one or more command line switches are specified they are embedded in
the output file names as additional suffixes before the final file type.
$ ./aaconvert.sh -l 5 image.pgm
generates image.diff.l5.pgm, image.ascii.l5.txt and image.ascii.l5.pgm.

Available options:

-l <scale> - differentiated image levels scaling

Adjusts differential edge map "brightness".
Specify small integer in the range of 1..20 (approx).
1 is "normalized" is the sense that it never clips
the values (but is too dark for most images).
The current default is 4.

-d <kernel> - differentiation kernel (size)

Adjust the detail/noise sensitivity.
Available kernel sizes: 2, 3, 4.
The default is 3 (Sobel operator).
Specifying 1 skips the differentiation step entirely (aalib-style).

-m <id> - match method

Selects the character matching algorithm used.

Available options:

 1 - Minimize SAD (sum of absolute differences)
 2 - Minimize weighted SAD + ASD (absolute sum of differences)

The current default is 2.

Notes:
 * MIN(SAD) is the tried and proven method used in video motion compensation.
 * MIN(SAD + ASD) tries to preserve perceptible tile brightness
   as well as its shape.

-s <id> - offset search method

Selects the offset searching algorithm.

Available options:

 1 - No offset search is performed. The tiles are matched exactly where they
     are in the source image.
 2 - Diamond search. Additionally checks whether better matches can be
     obtained by offsetting the source image tile by 1 pixel along any axis
     ("diamond" pattern). Runs match search 5 times.
 3 - Box search. The same as diamond + the diagonal moves are checked
     ("box" pattern). Runs match search 9 times.

The current default is 1 - No search.

-c <1/0> - enable/disable search coverage test

Only affects offset search strategy.
Performs match score adjustment for off-center matches to improve
source image feature coverage by the character tiles.
Can often drastically improve offset search results.

The current default is 0 - disabled.

-W <sad>.<asd> - SAD/ASD weight ratio

<sad> and <asd> parameters tune the SAD+ASD match algorithm.
Specify two integers separated by dot ('.').
It's NOT a real number, but rather a ratio of weights <sad>/<asd>.
Zeros are allowed and meaningful (0 and infinity).
The matching algorithm looks for MIN(<sad>*SAD + <asd>*ASD).

The default values are <sad> = 5 and <asd> = 2.

AAFONT environment variable overrides the default the font image.

2.1 Using the test utilities (plumbing)

Generate the differentiated image:

$ ./testdiff [-l <scale>] [-d <kernel>] image.pgm image.diff.pgm

Generate ASCII text file from the differentiated image:

$ ./testconv [-m <id>] [-s <id>] [-c <1/0>] [-W <sad>.<asd>] image.diff.pgm font/font8x16.pgm image.ascii.txt

Render ASCII text back into an image:

$ ./testrender image.ascii.txt font/font8x16.pgm image.ascii.pgm

'-' supplied as an argument uses stdin or stdout for inputs and
outputs respectively.
'--' option separator is required to use '-'.

font/font8x16.pgm is the VGA terminal font image supplied as a sample.
The font bitmap characters are stacked vertically starting from
the whitespace character (ASCII 0x20).

All image files are in the Portable GrayMap (PGM) format.
ImageMagick or netpbm may be used to generate compatible input(s) and
convert output(s) into something more usable.

3. Tweaking

Tweaking command line parameters:

Changing -l <scale> adjusts the amount of detail (and noise) that makes
it into the final ASCII picture.
Check generated .diff.pgm file to see the effect of the adjustments.

Changing -d <kernel> adjusts the detail sensitivity level.
Heavily oversampled images require larger kernels (4),
while vector drawing and pixel art details are better preserved by
smaller kernels (2). 3 is a reasonable default.

Changing -m <method> affects the match search strategy:
  * SAD (1) looks for the most similar character representation.
  * SAD+ASD (2) tries to optimize for the overall perceptible similarity
                at the expense of larger small-scale errors.

Tweaking -W <sad>.<asd> weights ratio tunes SAD+ASD method
to pay more attention to shape (SAD) or overall brightness (ASD).
Due to the nature of the minimization problem, only the ratio of the weights is
significant, i.e. the default -W 5.2 is the same as -W 10.4.
-W 1.0 is the same as -m 1, but slower, -W 0.1 is pure ASD (like aalib).
Example:
$ ./aaconvert.sh -l1 -d1 -W0.1 test.pgm
Yields the result very similar to what aalib does.
It skips the differentiation (codes levels rather than edges) and
uses ASD (average level) for the match search.

Enabling offset search via -s 2 or -s 3 allows for better character matches
at the price of small spatial jitter. This usually results in visually
"cleaner" image. However, the search algorithm tends to avoid thin lines
at the edges of the image tiles by stepping away from them. Skipped lines
are not included in the match search often resulting in smaller match errors.
Note:
Diamond search (-s 2) checks 5 possible offsets for each tile,
resulting in 5x slowdown compared to direct matching.
Box (-s 3) search analyzes 9 neighboring locations, making it 9x slower.

Enabling coverage test via -c 1 compensates for the edge skipping effect by
including not matched parts of the source tile in the total match error.
Stepping away from a feature results in the same match error as matching
it with black level.
The coverage test should always be enabled when using offset search for
the best output quality.
