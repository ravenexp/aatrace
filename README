aatrace - Yet another ASCII-art generator

1. Building

$ make

while (!works)
      tweak(Makefile);

2. Usage

Using convenience wrapper script:

$ ./aaconvert.sh image.pgm

Generates image.diff.pgm, image.txt and image.txt.pgm files
in the current directory.
image.diff.pgm is an intermediate differentiated image output,
image.txt is the text output and image.txt.pgm is the image output.

AAFONT environment variable overrides the default the font image.

2.1 Using the test utilities (plumbing)

Generate differentiated image:

$ ./testdiff image.pgm image.diff.pgm

Generate ASCII text file from the differentiated image:

$ ./testconv image.diff.pgm font/font8x16.pgm image.txt

Render ASCII text back into image:

$ ./testrender image.txt font/font8x16.pgm image.txt.pgm

All arguments are required.
'-' supplied as an argument uses stdin or stdout for inputs and
outputs respectively.

font/font8x16.pgm is the VGA terminal font image supplied as a sample.
The font bitmap characters are stacked vertically starting from
the whitespace character (ASCII 0x20).

All image files are in the Portable GrayMap (PGM) format.
ImageMagick or netpbm may be used to generate compatible input(s) and
convert output(s) into something more usable.

3. Tweaking

Tweaking definitions in aatrace.h:

Changing AATRACE_DIFF_SCALE (gradient map scaling)
roughly adjust ASCII "brightness".
Changing aatrace_diff (differentiation kernel size)
adjust detail/noise sensitivity.
Check generated .diff.pgm file to see the effect of the adjustments.
